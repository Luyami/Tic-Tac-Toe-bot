# Tic-Tac-Toe
In this tic-tac-toe game, you will play against a super smart robot (or is it?)

# How does the bot works?
The bot's logic is based on an Artificial Intelligence method called **Minimax algorithm** 

# Feel free to try to beat the bot
In order to beat the bot, you must defy the laws of physics (: (or just do some adjustments in source code)
